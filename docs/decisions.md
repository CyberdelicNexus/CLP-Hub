# Decision log

Append-only. Newest at the bottom. Record assumptions here rather than silently deciding.

**Current phase: 0 (Foundation) — awaiting founder review before Phase 1.**

---

## D-001 · 2026-09-03 · Monolith on Next.js 16 + Supabase Postgres

One app, one database, Drizzle with hand-written SQL migrations. Matches the founder's other project's conventions (Next 16, React 19, Tailwind 4, shadcn). Drizzle Kit is used for checks only; migrations stay reviewable SQL that can also be pasted into the Supabase dashboard.

## D-002 · 2026-09-03 · No external error monitoring

Founder decision: no Sentry. Structured pino logs with PII redaction. Operational failures will surface as in-app alerts (Phase 8).

## D-003 · 2026-09-03 · Participants never authenticate

Founder decision: the "study hub" is not a learning platform. Study material is published as public, blog-style Spanish pages. Consequences: no magic links, no per-participant progress table, no personalised hub. Public pages must contain no participant data. VR readiness is captured by staff or via a simple public form, not inferred.

## D-004 · 2026-09-03 · WhatsApp is manual

No WhatsApp API. Each cohort gets a "Mensajes" page with every message rendered in Spanish with real dates and links plus a copy button. Facilitators paste manually and mark as sent, which creates the immutable communication record. Email may remain automatable for logistics via Resend (Phase 7).

## D-005 · 2026-09-03 · Vercel Cron instead of Trigger.dev

With WhatsApp manual and email volume low, a cron-invoked processor over `scheduled_actions` is sufficient. The processor boundary keeps the option to swap in Trigger.dev later.

## D-006 · 2026-09-03 · Authorization in code, RLS as deny-all

Permissions live in `src/domain/permissions.ts` and are enforced server-side. All tables have RLS enabled with no policies and explicit revokes for `anon`/`authenticated`, so the Supabase API keys cannot read anything. This avoids duplicating the permission matrix in SQL. Hardening item: dedicated least-privilege DB role before real data.

## D-007 · 2026-09-03 · Locale via cookie, no URL prefix

Staff UI locale comes from an httpOnly `clp_locale` cookie synced with `users.preferred_locale` (audited). Public pages default to Spanish. No `/es/` `/en/` routing.

## D-008 · 2026-09-03 · Roles as enum, no `roles` table

The five roles are a fixed vocabulary with permissions in code; a `roles` table would add nothing. `user_roles` is historical (revoke, never delete).

## D-009 · 2026-09-03 · All communication touchpoints Spanish

Every template must have a Spanish version; English is optional and only for staff preview. Enforced in Phase 7 schema constraints.

## D-010 · 2026-09-03 · Naming

Repository "CLP Hub" (`clp-hub`). The trial's name is not referenced in code; the seed study is `DEMO`. Team dashboard lives under `/equipo`.

## D-011 · 2026-09-03 · Design system: "soft modern", light and dark

Founder direction, from reference dashboards. A bento-grid surface system: rounded
cards, pastel accent surfaces, soft diffuse elevation, Plus Jakarta Sans display
over Geist body. Full token layer in `src/app/globals.css` with complete `:root`
and `.dark` palettes; see `docs/design-system.md`.

Considered and rejected: an industrial-brutalist direction (zero radius, hazard
red, monospace, scanlines). It conflicts with the reference material and reads as
a strong personality for a tool clinical staff use daily. Its defensible parts were
kept — deterministic grid, tabular numerals for metrics, semantic markup.

Consequences: pastel tokens are backgrounds only and always paired with an `-ink`
foreground, so no accent ever carries meaning by itself; contrast stays ≥ 4.5:1 in
both modes. Also fixed a latent bug where `--font-sans` resolved to nothing and the
UI fell back to the browser default font.

## D-012 · 2026-09-03 · Theme preference is device-local and not audited

`next-themes` stores light/dark/system in `localStorage`. Deliberately unlike the
locale (D-007), which lives on the staff profile and is audited: the theme is a
rendering preference, not user state or a research-relevant setting, so it gets no
database column, no cookie and no audit row. Revisit only if staff ask for the
choice to follow them across devices.

## Open questions for researchers

- Hosting region / data processing agreements before any real participant.
- Erasure vs. audit immutability: pseudonymization approach acceptable?
- Audit retention period.
- Whether email reminders may be AUTOMATIC or should also be manual.
- MFA requirement for staff.
